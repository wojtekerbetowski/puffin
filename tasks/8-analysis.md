* Use the timer.timer decorator to store execution time
* Run analyze notebook to plat execution times
* Calculate extra insights
  * What is the difference between the longest and shortest execution time (per function)
* Add execution time to timer (when was the function called)
  * Plot execution time versus when it started
  * Use `cumsum` to build aggregate diagram
